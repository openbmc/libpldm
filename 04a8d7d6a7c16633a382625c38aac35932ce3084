      "message": "Okay, I was brainstorming the naming with Sagar and came up with `pldm_entity_association_tree_find_with_locality()`. What does everyone think of that? I think the improvement is it lifts the language from the specific to the conceptual - instead of embedding one of the specific locality options (\"remote\") in the name we specify the concept of (\"locality\") instead.",
