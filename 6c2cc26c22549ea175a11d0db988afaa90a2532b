      "message": "So, as some pretext, I\u0027ve been going back-and-forth on this internally.\n\nDo you mind leaving this as `uint8_t`? How C compilers treat `enum` storage is implementation-defined, and this can make FFI bindings tricky.\n\nFrom an FFI perspective we\u0027d ideally drop enums from the public APIs entirely (and instead use macros for constants and fixed-width integer types).",
