      "message": "@andrew@codeconstruct.com.au So, I ran into a snag with your suggestion. Just having these as __attribute__(weak) did not let me override the function by defining it in https://github.com/openbmc/libpldm/blob/main/tests/transport/send_recv_timeout.cpp#L7. Probably because we build libpldm as a library and include it into the C++ test executables.\n\nI could have send_recv_timeout.cpp define libpldm_clock_gettimeval and notice that libpldm calls its own internal function since the linter does not hold onto it.\n\nThe only way was for me to do some function pointer, expose another `libpldm_set_impl_gettimeval` which takes in a function pointer which can override internal aspects. Any ideas? Probably some linker magic?",
