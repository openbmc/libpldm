      "message": "I do wonder whether it would be more effective to define the API like:\n\n```\nint decode_get_state_effecter_states_resp(const struct pldm_msg *msg,\n    size_t payload_length,\n    uint8_t *completion_code,\n    uint8_t *composite_effecter_count,\n    struct variable_field *field)\n```\n\nand then add a second API to decode from the `struct variable_field *field` out-parameter into an array of `get_effecter_state_field` objects. The split allows the caller to allocate exactly the memory required relative to `composite_effecter_count`.\n\nI\u0027m marking this comment as resolved because maybe we answer the question by gaining experience using the API in anger, and as its `LIBPLDM_ABI_TESTING` we can come back and fix it if needed. However, I\u0027m interested in your thoughts.",
