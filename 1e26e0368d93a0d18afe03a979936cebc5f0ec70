My apologies.\n\n\u003e I think we should not drop the negation, in the description about timercmp():\n\nI think we should assume that we\u0027re not operating with a broken `timercmp()` implementation. If someone wants to run libpldm on a platform that has such a broken implementation then they can fix it then. Let\u0027s keep the code simple to understand, we\u0027ve already messed it up once ðŸ˜Š",
