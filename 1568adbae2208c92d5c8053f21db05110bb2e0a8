      "message": "Unfortunately that\u0027s not enough of an explanation. In explicit detail, what do you mean by \"encountered a circulare dependency when we used these definitions in a private header file instead\"? How did you organise the code? How does putting the definition in a public header file change that problem?",

      "message": "I agree Andrew, This splitting was done, when we had oem-IBM implementations of the pldm_last_local_record() function. But since now all of that is moved to a standard way of defining a function here - https://gerrit.openbmc.org/c/openbmc/libpldm/+/63612/5/src/pdr.c#970, this commit could be reverted. I believe we don\u0027t need to put the definition in a public header file.",
