      "message": "@arj, I understand that you may be unhappy with the declaration done here. But here is the problem I faced- \n\nI need to declare a pointer to be used in pldm_msgbuf_span_required because I need to skip some data in msgbuf and extract one specific data. When I put this inside a while loop I end up reusing the same pointer. This pointer is not initialized correctly in the next iteration that results in msgbuf pointing to the wrong address. I am not sure how to deference or reinitialize this pointer *skip_hdr_data and reuse the same variable inside while loop",
