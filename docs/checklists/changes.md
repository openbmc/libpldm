## Definitions

- **Error condition**: An invalid state reached at runtime, caused either by
  resource exhaustion, or incorrect use of the library's public APIs and data
  types.

- **Invariant**: A condition in the library's implementation that must never
  evaluate false.

- **Public API**: Any definitions and declarations under `include/libpldm`.

- **Wire format**: Any message structure defined in the DMTF PLDM protocol
  specifications.

## Elaborations

- Resource exhaustion is always an error condition and never an invariant
  violation.

- An invariant violation is always a programming failure of the library's
  implementation, and never the result of incorrect use of the library's public
  APIs (see error condition).

- Corollaries of the above two points:

  - Incorrect use of public API functions is always an error condition, and is
    dealt with by returning an error code.

  - Incorrect use of static functions in the library's implementation is an
    invariant violation which may be established using `assert()`.

- `assert()` is the recommended way to demonstrate invariants are upheld.

## Adding a new API

- [ ] My new public message codec functions take a `struct` representing the
      message as a parameter

  - Function prototypes must _not_ decompose the message to individual
    parameters. This approach is not ergonomic and is difficult to make
    type-safe. This is especially true for message decoding functions which must
    use pointers for out-parameters, where it has often become ambiguous whether
    the underlying memory represents a single object or an array.

- [ ] Each new `struct` I've defined is used in at least one new function I've
      added to the public API.

- [ ] My new public `struct` definitions are _not_ marked
      `__attribute__((packed))`

- [ ] My new public `struct` definitions do _not_ define a flexible array
      member, unless:

  - [ ] It's contained in an `#ifndef __cplusplus` macro guard, as flexible
        arrays are not specified by C++, and

  - [ ] I've implemented an accessor function so the array base pointer can be
        accessed from C++, and

  - [ ] It is defined as per the C17 specification by omitting the length[^1]

    - Note: Any array defined with length 1 is _not_ a flexible array, and any
      access beyond the first element invokes undefined behaviour in both C and
      C++.

  - [ ] I've annotated the flexible array member with `LIBPLDM_CC_COUNTED_BY()`

[^1]:
    [C17 draft specification][c17-draft-standard], 6.7.2.1 Structure and union
    specifiers, paragraph 18.

- [ ] If my work interacts with the PLDM wire format, then I have done so using
      the `msgbuf` APIs found in `src/msgbuf.h` (and under `src/msgbuf/`) to
      minimise concerns around spatial memory safety and endian-correctness.

- [ ] All my error conditions are handled by returning an error code to the
      caller.

- [ ] All my invariants are tested using `assert()`.

- [ ] I have not used `assert()` to evaluate any error conditions without also
      handling the error condition by returning an error code the the caller.

  - Release builds of the library are configured with `assert()` disabled
    (`-Db_ndebug=if-release`, which provides `-DNDEBUG` in `CFLAGS`).

- [ ] My new APIs return negative `errno` values on error and not PLDM
      completion codes.

  - [ ] The specific error values my function returns and their meaning in the
        context of the function call are listed in the API documentation.

- [ ] If I've added support for a new PLDM message type, then I've implemented
      both the encoder and decoder for that message. Note this applies for both
      request _and_ response message types.

- [ ] My new function symbols are marked with `LIBPLDM_ABI_TESTING` in the
      implementation

- [ ] I've implemented test cases with reasonable branch coverage of each new
      function I've added

- [ ] I've guarded the test cases of functions marked `LIBPLDM_ABI_TESTING` so
      that they are not compiled when the corresponding function symbols aren't
      visible

- [ ] If I've added support for a new message type, then my commit message
      specifies all of:

  - [ ] The relevant DMTF specification by its DSP number and title
  - [ ] The relevant version of the specification
  - [ ] The section of the specification that defines the message type

- [ ] If my work impacts the public API of the library, then I've added an entry
      to `CHANGELOG.md` describing my work

## Stabilising an existing API

- [ ] The API of interest is currently marked `LIBPLDM_ABI_TESTING`

- [ ] My commit message links to a publicly visible patch that makes use of the
      API

- [ ] My commit updates the annotation from `LIBPLDM_ABI_TESTING` to
      `LIBPLDM_ABI_STABLE` only for the function symbols demonstrated by the
      patch linked in the commit message.

- [ ] I've removed guards from the function's tests so they are always compiled

- [ ] If I've updated the ABI dump, then I've used the OpenBMC CI container to
      do so.

## Updating an ABI dump

Each of the following must succeed:

- [ ] Enter the OpenBMC CI Docker container
  - Approximately:
    `docker run --cap-add=sys_admin --rm=true --privileged=true -u $USER -w $(pwd) -v $(pwd):$(pwd) -e MAKEFLAGS= -it openbmc/ubuntu-unit-test:2024-W21-ce361f95ff4fa669`
- [ ] `CC=gcc CXX=g++; [ $(uname -m) = 'x86_64' ] && meson setup -Dabi=deprecated,stable build`
- [ ] `meson compile -C build`
- [ ] `./scripts/abi-dump-formatter < build/src/current.dump > abi/x86_64/gcc.dump`

## Removing an API

- [ ] If the function is marked `LIBPLDM_ABI_TESTING`, then I have removed it

- [ ] If the function is marked `LIBPLDM_ABI_STABLE`, then I have changed the
      annotation to `LIBPLDM_ABI_DEPRECATED` and left it in-place.

  - [ ] I have updated the ABI dump, or will mark the change as WIP until it has
        been.

- [ ] If the function is marked `LIBPLDM_ABI_DEPRECATED`, then I have removed it
      only after satisfying myself that each of the following is true:

  - [ ] There are no known users of the function left in the community
  - [ ] There has been at least one tagged release of `libpldm` subsequent to
        the API being marked deprecated

## Renaming an API

A change to an API is a pure rename only if there are no additional behavioural
changes. Renaming an API with no other behavioural changes is really two
actions:

1. Introducing the new API name
2. Deprecating the old API name

- [ ] Only the name of the function has changed. None of its behaviour has
      changed.

- [ ] Both the new and the old functions are declared in the public headers

- [ ] I've aliased the old function name to the new function name via the
      `libpldm_deprecated_aliases` list in `meson.build`

- [ ] I've added a [semantic patch][coccinelle] to migrate users from the old
      name to the new name

[coccinelle]: https://coccinelle.gitlabpages.inria.fr/website/

- [ ] I've updated the ABI dump to capture the rename, or will mark the change
      as WIP until it has been.

## Testing my changes

Each of the following must succeed when executed in order. Note that to avoid
[googletest bug #4232][googletest-issue-4232] you must avoid using GCC 12
(shipped in Debian Bookworm).

[googletest-issue-4232]: https://github.com/google/googletest/issues/4232

- [ ] `meson setup -Dabi-compliance-check=disabled build`
- [ ] `meson compile -C build && meson test -C build`

- [ ] `meson configure --buildtype=release build`
- [ ] `meson compile -C build && meson test -C build`

- [ ] `meson configure --buildtype=debug build`
- [ ] `meson configure -Dabi=deprecated,stable build`
- [ ] `meson compile -C build && meson test -C build`

This process is captured in `scripts/pre-submit` for automation.
