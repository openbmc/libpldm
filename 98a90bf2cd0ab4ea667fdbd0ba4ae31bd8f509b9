      "message": "I think this comparison might be a concern. For example, let:\n\n1. `pdr-\u003enum_children \u003d\u003d 1`\n2. `child_index \u003d\u003d 1`\n\nSubstituting into the condition yields:\n\n```\nif (1 \u003c 1) {\n    continue;\n}\n```\n\n`1 \u003c 1` evaluates to false and therefore we do not reach the `continue` and instead perform an out-of-bounds access on line 419. This problem generalises to any invocation where `pdr-\u003enum_children \u003d\u003d child_index` holds. Essentially the inequality used causes an off-by-one error.\n\nThe following yields correct behaviour and IMO is a bit easier to understand:\n\n```\nif (child_index \u003e\u003d pdr-\u003enum_children) {\n    continue;\n}\n```\n\nAnd with that the test below on line 415 becomes redundant.",
