It violates the documentation point here of \"nothing openbmc specific in this repo\".\n2. The APIs do not actually work outside of a very specific mctp path.\n3. It violates our overall architecture of not having protocol details leaking into every other repository.  I have no idea, for instance, why phosphor-logging has any knowledge whatsoever of PLDM as it does today.",
