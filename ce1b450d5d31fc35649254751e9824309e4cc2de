      "message": "Let\u0027s go with `_full` for now. But, I think eventually we want to get rid of the wire-format structs from the header. Given that, it would be nice if down the track we can rename the structs to drop `_full`. In order to get there we could also now add a typedef for the `_full` structs and document that consumers should use the typedef rather than a raw `struct ..._full`. Then down the track when we\u0027ve removed the wire-format structs we can drop the `_full` from the struct name and deprecate the typedef for removal.\n\nThoughts?\n\nPerhaps if the typedef doesn\u0027t have the `_full` suffix but maps to the `_full` struct it will be easier to \"remove\" down the track after we\u0027ve renamed the struct, as it will be a matter of adding `struct ` in-front of the typedef name where it\u0027s used.",
