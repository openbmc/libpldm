      "message": "Hello Harsh,\n\nThanks for pushing the patch. However, has this been discussed in the community anywhere prior to pushing it? I ask because we\u0027re in the middle of remodelling the requester API? It looks like what you have may not be impacted by that as you appear to externalise the process of sending and receiving the messages in question, but maybe it\u0027s worth considering.\n\nhttps://gerrit.openbmc.org/c/openbmc/libpldm/+/59576\n\nAlso why was it initially a private patch? There a bunch of feedback while it was private. Generally it\u0027s best to engage the community from the start and not try to pre-review things, as community consensus may drive the effort in an entirely different direction (which would put that pre-review effort to waste).",

      "message": "Hey Andrew,\nThanks for the feedback. \n\n* The change you linked, as you said, does not seem to affect our implementation. We are planning to make a separate RDE daemon (In PLDM repo) which talks to this Requester library (which is what this code review is about) to initiate the PLDM Base commands in the correct sequence and help in maintaining the context. I haven\u0027t put this on the discord channel yet, but I can post a short summary of what we are trying to do.\n\n* \"Why was this patch private and have an internal feedback?\" - Since it was my first change, I was taking guidance from other senior engineers, but I understand what you said. I will keep it in mind. Thanks",

Is this code the only one setting it or will the app also be setting it? If the app is supposed to do or not do specific things based off this status, can we document that? I initially assumed that this requester status was for controlling the sequence of events ie if an app calls pldm_base_get_next_request before pldm_base_start_discovery, then we wouldn\u0027t do anything - but that doesn\u0027t seem to be the case.",
