I can\u0027t apply this as it breaks the function ABI (users may be testing for specific return values).\n\nIn the previous patch I did say (paraphrasing) \"please avoid adding new calls to pldm_msgbuf_init_cc(), use pldm_msgbuf_init_errno()\", but that was a request that was specific to the _test_ implementation and didn\u0027t extend to the implementation of the library API.",
