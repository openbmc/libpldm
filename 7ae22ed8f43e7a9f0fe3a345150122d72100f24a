      "message": "Hi Thu, I\u0027ve left a note about removing the `_unpkg` struct entirely. It\u0027s not the case that the `msgbuf` APIs _require_ a struct that isn\u0027t packed, rather the use of the `msgbuf` APIs allow us to _not require_ a packed struct (and this is better for correctness, portability, and performance).\n\nPut another way, it\u0027s still fine to use the `msgbuf` APIs to extract data into a packed struct member.",

      "message": "The point I was trying to make on PS4 is that we can drop this completely. There should be no need to bounce through such a struct, instead we can decode straight into the `pdr_value` object passed in as a parameter, and avoid the copying at the bottom of the function.\n\nAgain the point I was trying to make was it\u0027s still important to use the `msgbuf` APIs here as the result will be endian-correct.",
