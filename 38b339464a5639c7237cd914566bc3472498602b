Further, I think \"wait for message\" is slightly misleading. Really we\u0027re waiting for an event to occur that needs to be addressed by the API; we may not strictly be waiting for a message. Leaning on POSIX and libmctp we\u0027ve called things that do this `poll`. How about:\n\n```\npldm_requester_rc_t pldm_requester_poll(...)\n```\n\n?",
