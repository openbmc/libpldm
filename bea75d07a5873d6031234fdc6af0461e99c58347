      "message": "Hi Pavithra, nice work on updating the ABI dumps. However it looks like the x86_64 dump has been updated without restricting the build via `-Dabi\u003ddeprecated,stable` (it includes symbols marked `LIBPLDM_ABI_TESTING`). Hopefully if you fix that (i.e., configure the x86_64 build with e.g. `meson setup -Dabi\u003ddeprecated,stable builds/x86_64/stable`) the diff won\u0027t be quite so large.",
