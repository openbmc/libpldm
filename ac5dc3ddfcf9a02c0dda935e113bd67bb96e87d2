      "message": "This struct was initially created to be used in `decode_base_multipart_receive_resp()` (now `decode_pldm_base_multipart_receive_resp()`). Then I think @john.chung@arm.com is using it for an also TESTING API `encode_base_multipart_receive_resp()`. So I assume they are the only places using it (pldmd won\u0027t use it alone unless to support the call to one of the mentioned APIs, right?)\n\nBoth APIs are TESTING, and as long as they are both not stabilized yet, I think the struct must have not been used anywhere, right? (at least based on my quick search).",

If all functions in the library API using a given type or its pointer are marked testing, then I consider the type itself to also be in the testing set. This is also how `abi-compliance-checker` works. The change has passed CI, so `abi-compliance-checker` has not indicated a concern. Therefore the rename is okay.\n\n@pavithrabarithaya07@gmail.com if this makes sense, please mark the thread as resolved.",
