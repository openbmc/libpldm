      "message": "A nitpick that I think we can resolve given the other issue with validation below: There\u0027s a silly inconsistency between the names of `struct timeval` and the `timer*()` functions. I think I\u0027d prefer the name to be in terms of the struct here and not get ourselves confused in the extra `r` business. It would be nice to rename this to `timeval_to_msec()` without the `r`. Apologies if I got that wrong in my comment where I defined this function.",
