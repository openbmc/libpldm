      "message": "I prefer we don\u0027t do this. `pldm_transport_send_recv_msg()` very much a convenience API for simple use cases, though that\u0027s kind of complicated by the mctp-demux transport behaviour of all listeners receiving all messages.\n\nIf users of libpldm need to care about these problems then they should use the building blocks of `pldm_transport_send_msg()`, `pldm_transport_poll()`, and `pldm_transport_recv_msg()` to get the right behaviour.\n\nOtherwise, as is, we\u0027re discarding potentially valid messages. `AF_MCTP` will typically operate in unconnected mode, which will yield the same problems (though to a lesser extent).",
