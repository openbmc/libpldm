      "message": "This is the part that is labeled `Action Information area` in the specification.\n\nIt contains\n```\n  ActionCount\n  ActionNameLengthBytes [0]\n  ActionName [0]\n  ActionPathLengthBytes [0]\n  ...\n  ActionNameLengthBytes [N]\n  ActionName [N]\n  ActionPathLengthBytes [N]\n```\nIt is also returned in the `pldm_platform_redfish_action_pdr.action_info`.\n\nI think I find it lacking that in case of the foreach API that we implement there is no easy way to get `ActionCount` without full iterating.\n\nWhat is preffered way to add this?\n1) add `uint8_t action_count` to the pdr structure\n2) add `uint8_t action_count` to the action_info structure\n3) create another API to get it from the `action_info` structure\n\nThe easiest way is 1/2, in case we do that, do we need to move `area.ptr` after the `ActionCount` field, or can we leave things as they are?",
