      "message": "I guess another thought is that we could make it behave like the return value for `poll(2)`. The only thing would be it could return at most a value of 1, as we\u0027re only polling one transport. A return value of 0 would mean timeout.\n\nI feel like that\u0027s probably the most satisfactory approach (principle of least surprise for people who know `poll(2)`\u0027s behaviour).",
