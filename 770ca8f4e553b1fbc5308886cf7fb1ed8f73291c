The libpldm doesn\u0027t have the routing, right?  It is up to the pldmd to call the appropriate functions based on which device / OEM it is communicating with, right?\n\nMy reading is that PLDM doesn\u0027t explicitly have an IANA field, or similar, in OEM commands.  We have flexibility in the Meta ones where we could certainly define an OEM command that ends up with the {IANA + secondary command number} embedded as an early part of the payload but I don\u0027t think there is any way to do that natively in PLDM.\n\nIt is quite possible to need to enable multiple OEM command sets on a BMC.  Suppose, for example, that we have two different NIC vendors both using PLDM but with their own set of OEM commands.  We would need to support both of those OEM sets at once because either NIC could be attached to the BMC.",
